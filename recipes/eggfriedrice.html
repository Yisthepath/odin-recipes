            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Preparation:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If you don't have day-old rice, spread freshly cooked rice on a baking sheet and let it cool. For best results, refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Prepare all vegetables and keep them nearby for quick access.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Cook the Eggs:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet or wok, heat about 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. Allow them to set slightly and then scramble them. Once cooked, remove the eggs from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Sauté the Vegetables:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add a bit more oil to the skillet if needed and increase the heat to medium-high.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onions, and if you're using garlic, add it now. Sauté until the onions become translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the other vegetables, like the peas and carrots. Stir-fry until they're tender and slightly browned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Fry the Rice:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Push the vegetables to the side of the skillet or wok, or remove them and set them aside. Add the remaining oil.</li>
                <li>Add the rice to the skillet. Spread it out evenly and let it cook untouched for 1-2 minutes to get a bit crispy. Then, stir and break any clumps.</li>
                <li>If you removed the vegetables, add them back in now. Mix everything well.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Season the Dish:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the soy sauce and sesame oil (if using) over the rice. Stir-fry everything to ensure even distribution of the sauces.</li>
                <li>Add the scrambled eggs back into the skillet, breaking them into smaller pieces and mixing well.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper, adjusting to taste.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Final Touches:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add any optional proteins or additional ingredients, if you're using them. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced green onions and stir for another minute.</li>
                <li>If desired, sprinkle a dash of white pepper or chili flakes and any fresh herbs like cilantro or basil.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Serve:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Once everything is well-mixed and hot, transfer the egg fried rice to a serving dish or individual plates.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
