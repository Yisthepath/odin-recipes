            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Moroccan couscous is an exquisite, emblematic dish that captures the very essence of Moroccan culinary tradition. Made from tiny granules of steamed semolina wheat, it forms the base of a meal that is both comforting and aromatic. Traditionally prepared in a special steamer called a couscoussier, the couscous grains are painstakingly steamed to perfection, ensuring a light and fluffy texture. Atop these delicate grains, a richly flavored stew is poured, teeming with tender chunks of lamb, beef, or chicken, and an assortment of root vegetables like carrots, turnips, and zucchini. Spiced with a unique blend of coriander, saffron, ginger, and cinnamon, among others, this dish is given its characteristic warmth and depth. To add color, texture, and a sweet contrast, one might also find caramelized onions, raisins, and chickpeas interspersed. Garnished with fresh cilantro or parsley, Moroccan couscous is more than just a meal; it's a harmonious symphony of flavors, textures, and traditions, presented on a single plate.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Preparing the Couscous:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse and Hydrate: Begin by rinsing the couscous in cold water to remove any excess starch. Drain it and then let it sit for about 20 minutes to slightly hydrate.</li>
                <li>Fluffing: After hydrating, gently break apart any clumps with your fingers and mix in a bit of olive oil or butter. This helps in ensuring the grains remain separate and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Steam: Traditionally, couscous is steamed over the stew using a couscoussier. Fill the bottom part with the meat and vegetables stew, and place the couscous in the top section to steam. If you don't have a couscoussier, you can use a regular steamer. Steam the couscous for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Second Steam: Remove the couscous from the steamer, fluff again and let it cool a bit. Steam a second time for another 15 minutes until it's fully cooked and fluffy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Preparing the Stew:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Brown the Meat: In a large pot or the bottom part of the couscoussier, heat the oil or clarified butter. Add the meat chunks and brown them on all sides.</li>
                <li>Aromatics: Add the finely chopped onions and minced garlic to the pot. Sauté until they are translucent and aromatic.</li>
                <li>Spices and Vegetables: Introduce the spices—ginger, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, saffron (or turmeric), salt, and pepper. Stir well before adding the hard vegetables like carrots and turnips.</li>
                <li>Liquids: Pour in the water or broth, ensuring that the meat and vegetables are submerged. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Simmering: Cover the pot and let the stew simmer until the meat is halfway cooked. This might take 30 to 40 minutes depending on the meat's type and cut.</li>
                <li>Additional Vegetables: Add the softer vegetables like zucchini, tomatoes, and chickpeas, and continue to simmer. If using raisins, they can be added at this stage.</li>
                <li>Finalizing the Stew: Once the meat and vegetables are tender and the stew is flavorful, adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Combining the Couscous and Stew:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Serving: Transfer the steamed couscous to a large serving dish. Make a well in the center and ladle the meat and vegetables into this well. Pour some broth over the couscous, ensuring it's moist but not soggy.</li>
                <li>Garnish: Finish off by garnishing with fresh cilantro or parsley.</li>
            </ol>
