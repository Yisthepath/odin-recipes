        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and pat dry the chicken. Slice it into thin strips.</li>
            <li>Slice the bell peppers and onions into thin strips.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Marinating the Chicken</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together olive oil, lime juice, minced garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, pepper, and optionally, crushed red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced chicken to the bowl, ensuring all pieces are well-coated with the marinade.</li>
            <li>Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour in the refrigerator. For best results, marinate for 2-3 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking the Vegetables</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced bell peppers and onions, sautéing until they are soft and slightly caramelized, which should take around 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the vegetables from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking the Chicken</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the marinated chicken strips into the skillet, ensuring they are spread out and not overcrowded.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes or until fully cooked through and slightly browned on the outside. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, you can return the vegetables to the skillet and toss them with the chicken, or keep them separate based on your presentation preference.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if necessary.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Warming the Tortillas</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a clean skillet or comal, warm each tortilla for about 20-30 seconds on each side or until soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can wrap a stack of tortillas in aluminum foil and warm them in a preheated oven (350°F or 175°C) for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serving</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To assemble a fajita, take a warm tortilla, add some of the chicken and vegetable mixture, and top with your desired toppings such as guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, shredded cheese, and more.</li>
            <li>Lay out all the toppings and accompaniments.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with lime wedges on the side for an added zesty flavor.</li>
        </ol>    
        <h3>Enjoyment</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Enjoy your fajitas!</li>
